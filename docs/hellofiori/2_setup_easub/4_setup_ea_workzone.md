# Setup SAP Build Work Zone Service in your Enterprise Account

SAP Build Work Zone enables you to easily create business sites that provide centralized access to applications, such as the Hello World app you will create.

## Prerequisites

You need an entitlement for SAP SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition service in your Global Account

You need a Cloud Identity Services tenant (Identity and Authentication service, IAS). If you don't have one, create one first. If you need help creating one, see the mission "Get Started with SAP BTPâ€”Cloud Identity Service Provider" in the Discovery Center.

### Check the Trust Configuration in your Subaccount

SAP Build Work Zone needs a Trust Configuration for your Identity Provider. In this example, you use BTP Cloud Identity Services.

1. Open your Global Account and your Subaccount for Fiori.
2. Open "Security" --> "Trust Configuration"
3. The "Default Identity Provider" is the Provider from the BTP platform, used for the Subaccount Administrator.
4. The "Custom IAS tenant" (or any other name for your custom IAS) is the identity provider for your SAP Build Work Zone service.

5. You can also check the custom IAS configuration for your user.

If you don't have a custom IAS yet, create one in the next step.

### Create a Trust Configuration in your Subaccount

Create a Trust Configuration for your custom IAS service.

1. Open your Global Account and your Subaccount for Fiori.
2. Open "Security" --> "Trust Configuration"
3. Click "Establish Trust". A wizard pop-up will open.

10. Check your user for the custom IAS. Go to "Security" --> "Users".

     A user for your custom IAS should have been created. If not, create one. Click on both users to see the details. The default user should have the Subaccount Administrator Role Collection. 
     The custom IAS user should be empty if just created (you will assign the Launchpad Admin later).
