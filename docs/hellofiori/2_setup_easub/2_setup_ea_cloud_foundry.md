# Enable Cloud Foundry Runtime in your Subaccount

The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime lets you deploy cloud-native cloud foundry applications and run them on the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment.

For example, you developed a SAPUI5 or Fiori application in your Business Application Studio (BAS) and you want to deploy it to SAP BTP and run it there.


### Use Existing or Create New Subaccount

You can enable an existing Subaccount in your BTP Global Account or create a new Subaccount. 

If you want to create a new Subaccount follow this procedure:

1. Enter your Global Account --> Account Explorer.

    Select "Create".

    Choose "Subaccount"

2. Provide the configuration for Cloud Foundry Runtime:

    - Service Plan ("standard")
    - Select the Landscape

        Some regions provide "Sub-Landscapes" for technical reasons. Choose your Landscape depending on your Subaccount, commercial model and region.

        For example, if your Subaccount is on eu-10 and your commercial model is "Subscription", choose eu-10-004 as cloud foundry landscape, in order to get enough free "Quota" on this landcsape.

        If your Subaccount is on eu-10 and your commercial model is "consumption based", choose eu-10 as cloud foundry landscape, you don`t need to maintain quota manually.

    - Provide an "Instance Name" 
    - Provide an Cloud Foundry "Org Name". 

    Choose "Create"
