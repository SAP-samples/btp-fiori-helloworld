# Prerequisites

For this mission, you need either an **SAP BTP trial account** or an **SAP BTP enterprise account**. 

You can get an Enterprise Account following the guide [Get an Enterprise Account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-neo-environment/get-enterprise-account?locale=en-US). 

We will guide you to a Trial Account later in this mission.

Optional: To run the **SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery** service, you will also need a public GitHub (Enterprise) account (e.g. at https://github.com/ )


### SAP BTP enterprise account

For the enterprise account, you will need the entitlements for

* Cloud Foundry Runtime
* SAP Business Application Studio** application, 
* SAP Build Work Zone service and 
* SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service (optional)

If you are using a cloud-credit-based SAP BTP account, the entitlements are already in place. But be are aware, that you will consume cloud credits if you do not use free-tier service plans.

You will need SAP BTP global account administrator privilege in your enterprise account.


### SAP BTP trial account

The SAP BTP Trial Account is pre-configured and has the entitlements for Cloud Foundry runtime environment, Business Application Studio (development environment), SAP Work Zone service and Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD) service.

The Work Zone service must be set-up. To use it follow the set-up guide for Trial Accounts in this mission.
