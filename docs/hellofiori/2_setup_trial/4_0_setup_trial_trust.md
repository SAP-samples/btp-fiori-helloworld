# Prerequisites for setting up SAP Build Work Zone in BTP Account

SAP Build Work Zone enables you to easily create business sites that provide centralized access to applications, such as the Hello World app you will create.

SAP Build Work Zone Service is not pre-configured in your BTP trial account. You must subscribe to the service first.

In order to set up SAP Build Work Zone in your Enterprise or Trial Account, you first need to establish Trust and Federation between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services.

You use your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant as an identity provider or a proxy for your own identity provider, which hosts your business users.

### Set up Cloud Identity Services

Navigate to Instances and Subscriptions in your subaccount. Check if you have already set up a Cloud Identity Service. If not, create one. It is mandatory to use SAP Build Work Zone.

1. First, check your entitlement in your Global Account. Go to your Subaccount (trial) and navigate to "Entitlements". Search for "Cloud Identity Services". If it is present, you can set it up.

     If you work with more than one CI service, you might receive an error. You have to delete your browser cache (easiest way is to close the browser and restart it)

12. Your Trial Cloud Identity Services Trial Account will open.
 
     Feel free to investigate your account and the options you have. For the basic setup, you are done.

### Establish Trust in BTP Trial

If you create an SAP Build Work Zone service in your Account now, you will fail. First, you have to establish trust between your Subaccount and your Cloud Identity Service.

![](images/2_trial_trust_20_subfailed.png)

1. In your subaccount, navigate to "Security" --> "Trust Configuration". If you do not have a Custom Identity Provider for your business users yet, click on "Establish Trust". A pop-up wizard opens.

2. Step 1: Choose a tenant for your Cloud Identity Services (in a trial environment, you usually have just one).

    ![](images/2_trial_trust_22_step1.png)

3. Step 2: Choose a domain for your custom identity provider.

4. Step 3: Configure your settings for your tenant. E.g., as shown in the figure.

    ![](images/2_trial_trust_24_step3.png)
