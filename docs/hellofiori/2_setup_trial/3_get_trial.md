# Sign up for a free Trial Account for SAP BTP

**Note:** You can skip this step in case you already have an SAP BTP Trial account.

The SAP BTP trial account comes already with pre-configured entitlements for  

- Cloud Foundry Runtime, 
- SAP Business Application Studio and 
- SAP Launchpad Service 

and you have the SAP BTP **global account administrator** privilege.

In the next steps, you will create an SAP Universal ID and get a SAP BTP trial account .
