# Setup SAP Build Work Zone Service in your Trial Account

SAP Build Work Zone enables you to easily create business sites that provide centralized access to applications, such as the Hello World app you will create.

SAP Build Work Zone Service is not pre-configured in your BTP trial account. You must subscribe to the service first.

In order to set up SAP Build Work Zone in your Trial Account, you first need to establish Trust and Federation between SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service and SAP Cloud Identity Services (see previous tutorial)


### Subscribe to the SAP Build Work Zone Service



1. Log into your trial subaccount, navigate to "Services" --> "Instances and Subscriptions," and choose "Create."

4. Click on the Work Zone Subscription. A new window will open with "Access Denied".

    You need to add the missing Role Collection "Launchpad_Admin" to your user. 

    The required role collections have already been created with the subscription to the Launchpad Service.

5. In the left-handed navigation pane of the BTP Cockpit, navigate to **Security --> Users** and click on users.

    In a trial account, you will basically see your own user. Click on your user. 

6. Click on "Assign Role Collection".

    - Launchpad_Admin

    Check that you have these Role Collections assigned (A Trial Account should have already set up Business Application Studio):
    
    - Business_Application_Studio_Administrator
    - Business_Application_Studio_Developer

    Click "Save".

8. Go back to "Services" --> Instances and Subscriptions" and click "SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition" again. 

    The Work Zone Site Manager should open. 
    
    In some cases, the browser still caches the old authorizations. In this case, close and restart the browser.
