## Protecting your application

**Procedure**

1. Open SAP Business Application Studio and in case open again the **Explorer** (Shortcut Ctrl+Shift+E).
  

2. Open the `xs-security.json` file. 

    You see that you did not define yet "scopes", no "role-templates" and no "role-collections". <br>

3. Add "scopes", "role-templates" and "role-collections".

    The scope is for example `$XSAPPNAME.Display` or `$XSAPPNAME.Create`. 
      
    In this case you just view the app, so you just need `$XSAPPNAME.Display` for  role templates and role collections.
 
    ```JSON
    {
      "xsappname": "sapbtphelloworldui5",
      "tenant-mode": "dedicated",
      "description": "Security profile of called application",
      "scopes": [
        {
        "name": "$XSAPPNAME.Display",
        "description": "Display the app as Platform or Business User"
        }
      ],
      "role-templates": [
        {
        "name": "HelloWorldDisplayRole",
        "description": "Hello World Display Role Template",
        "scope-references": [
            "$XSAPPNAME.Display"
        ]
        }
      ],
      "role-collections": [
            {
            "name": "HelloWorldDisplayRoleCollection",
            "description": "Hello World Display Role Collection",
            "role-template-references": [
            "$XSAPPNAME.HelloWorldDisplayRole"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    ```
  

4. Open the `xs-app.json` file.

    Add a scope to the route for the webapp. The authorization scope is required to access the target path. 
   
    Add the scope definition:  `"scope": "$XSAPPNAME.Display"`.

    In the picture, the scope definition is already added.

    ```JSON
    {
      "source": "^(.*)$",
      "target": "$1",
      "service": "html5-apps-repo-rt",
      "authenticationType": "xsuaa",
      "scope": "$XSAPPNAME.Display"
    }
    ```  
    
    These are just basic settings. For more information, see SAP Help Portal [Application Router Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/application-security-descriptor-configuration-syntax) and [@sap/approuter on npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter).
    
 
4. Right-click on the projects `mta.yaml` file and choose **Build MTA project**. 
   
5. Deploy your `mta_archives/sapbtphelloworldui5_0.0.1.mtar` to your Cloud Foundry space.

    Make sure you are logged into your Cloud Foundry subaccount.

    It takes a while to complete the task. You will see a success message in the console once it's done.
  
6. Open your Subaccount in the SAP BTP Cockpit and select **HTML5 Applications** on the left navigation pane. 

   Open your application `sapbtphelloworldui5`. Your deployed app will open in a new window. 

   What you should see is: `Forbidden`. If not, clear your browser cache completely. Close the browser and reopen it or make a hard reload via browser developer tools.

7. Open Security --> Roles and search for "hello". You will see the new created role "HelloWorldViewerRole" from the role template "HelloWorldViewerRole".

8. Open Security --> Role Collections and search for "hello". You will see the new created role collection "HelloWorldViewerRoleCollection". 
  
9. Open Security --> Users and select your user. Scroll down in the detail screen and select "Assign Role Collection" in the Role Collection context menu `...`. 

    Assign HelloWorldViewerRoleCollection to your user.

11. Start your application again. Usually you still see "Forbidden". You have to log-out and log-in again into the web application. The easiest way is to close the browser completely and open again, or use a second browser.   

     You should see your app again.
