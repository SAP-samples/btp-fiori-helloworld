# Prerequisites

For this mission, you need either an **SAP BTP enterprise account** or **SAP BTP trial account**.

Optional: To run the **SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery** service, you will also need a public GitHub (Enterprise) account (e.g. at https://github.com/ )


### SAP BTP enterprise account

For the enterprise account, you will need the entitlements for

- Cloud Foundry Runtime
- SAP Business Application Studio** application, 
- SAP Build Work Zone service and 
- SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service (optional)

If you are using a consumption-based Global Account, the entitlements are already in place. But be aware, that you will consume cloud credits if you don't use free-tier service plans.

You will need SAP BTP global account administrator privilege in your enterprise account.

You can get an Enterprise Account following the guide [Get an Enterprise Account](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/getting-global-account?locale=en-US).


### SAP BTP trial account

The SAP BTP Trial Account is preconfigured and has the entitlements for the Cloud Foundry runtime environment, Business Application Studio (development environment), Work Zone Service, and Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD) service.

The Work Zone service must be set up. To use it follow the set-up guide for Trial Accounts in this mission.

We will guide you to a Trial Account later in this mission or follow the tutorial [Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
